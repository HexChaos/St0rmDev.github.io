Please take a look at my repos :) \r\n@StormDev\r\n## About me!\r\n\r\nEver since I can remember I was using the computer and always had access to the internet. By the age of nine I was able to use the internet comfortably. When I turned 11 I started to get involved in learning how things worked and then a friend told me that I should try visual basic. I was amazed, that using this simple program I could make my own software. Then I started getting into learning how it worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
